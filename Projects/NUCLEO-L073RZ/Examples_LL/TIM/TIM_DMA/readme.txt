@par Example Description

Use of the DMA with a timer update request 
to transfer data from memory to Timer Capture Compare Register 3 (TIMx_CCR3). This 
example is based on the STM32L0xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

The following configuration values are used in this example:
  - TIM2CLK = SystemClock
  - Prescaler = 0 
  - TIM2 counter clock = SystemClock
  - SystemCoreClock is set to 2.097 MHz for STM32L0xx Devices.

The objective is to configure TIM2 channel 3 to generate PWM edge aligned 
signal with a frequency equal to 17.57 KHz, and a variable duty cycle that
is changed by the DMA after each Update DMA request. The TIM2 Channel 3 Duty Cycle 
changes to the next new value defined by the aCCValue_Buffer.

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

Whenever a DMA transfer fails LED2 flashes with a frequency of 1 Hz.
 
@note PWM signal frequency value mentioned above is theoretical (obtained when
      the system clock frequency is exactly 80 MHz). Since the generated system
      clock frequency may vary from one board to another observed PWM signal
      frequency might be slightly different.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L073xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L073RZ-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L073RZ-Nucleo Rev C Set-up
    - Connect the TIM2 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM2_CH3  PB.10: connected to pin 25 of CN10 connector 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
