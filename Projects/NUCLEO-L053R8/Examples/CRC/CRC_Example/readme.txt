@par Example Description 

How to configure the CRC using the HAL API. The CRC (cyclic
redundancy check) calculation unit computes the CRC code of a given buffer of
32-bit data words, using a fixed generator polynomial (0x4C11DB7).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 2 MHz.

The CRC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_CRC_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_CRC_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed CRC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change CRC configuration.

The calculated CRC code is compared to displayed on the debugger in uwCRCValue variable.
Once calculated, the CRC value is compared to the CRC expected value.

STM32L053R8-Nucleo board's LED2 can be used to monitor the example status:
  - LED2 is ON when Right CRC calculated value
  - LED2 is OFF when Wrong CRC calculated value or there is an error in initialization.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L051xx, STM32L052xx, STM32L053xx STM32L062xx and 
    STM32L063xx device lines RevZ. 
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L053R8-Nucleo RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
      

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
